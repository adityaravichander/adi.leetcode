I have stamp


1. file petition with new employer before 60 days.. start working with receipt

2. if not within 60 days.. leave country.. but can come back with current visa and stamp. No 100k apply because not first time. No appointments needed. 


3. Visitor before 60 days. Tricky thing is that -- when I get new job. 

To apply for B1/B2 ... before 60 days... online myself in USCIS last minute as well. Interesting fact that I can do last minute. Through website myself - FORM I539.
